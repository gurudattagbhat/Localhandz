How to Use Each Part of the Website
-----------------------------------

1. User Registration & Login
   - Open `register.html` in your browser to access the user registration form.
   - Fill in your full name, email address, phone number, and password. The system will automatically check if the email or phone number is already registered and show a clear error if so.
   - Click the Register button. A loading spinner will appear, and you will see a confirmation message when registration is successful.
   - You will receive a welcome email at your registered email address.
   - After successful registration, you are redirected to `login.html`.
   - On the login page, enter your email and password to access your user dashboard.
   - If you forget your password, use the `forgot-password.html` page to reset it via email.

2. Service Booking
   - After logging in, browse available services on the homepage (`index.html`) or the full list at `services.html`.
   - Click on a service category (e.g., Plumber, Electrician) to see a list of available providers.
   - Click on a provider to view their details (`provider_details.html`).
   - Click the “Book Now” button to open the booking form popup.
   - Enter booking details such as date, time, and any specific requirements.
   - When you submit the booking, a loading popup with a spinner will appear, followed by a confirmation message.
   - You will receive a booking confirmation email with all details.
   - To view or manage your bookings, go to `my_bookings.html`. Here you can see upcoming and past bookings, and cancel if needed.

3. Provider Registration & Dashboard
   - If you are a service provider, open `register-service-provider.html` to register.
   - Fill in your name, email, phone, password, and select your service type from the dropdown (all available services are listed).
   - The system checks for duplicate email/phone and provides instant feedback.
   - On successful registration, you receive a welcome email and are redirected to the provider login page.
   - After logging in, access your dashboard at `service_provider_dashboard.html`.
   - In the dashboard, you can:
     - Edit your profile and update your service type or contact details.
     - Add, edit, or remove services you offer.
     - View all bookings made for your services, including customer details and booking times.
     - Access analytics to see your service performance and booking trends.

4. Admin Panel
   - The admin panel is accessed at `admin/admin_login.html` (only for authorized admins).
   - After logging in, the admin dashboard provides:
     - User management: View, edit, or remove users.
     - Provider management: Approve, edit, or remove service providers.
     - Order management: View all bookings and their statuses.
     - Feedback management: Review and respond to user/provider feedback.
